# Stock Market Dataset 
As a stock market advisor for John Doe, I have been tasked with analyzing stock market data from 2000 to 2017. The dataset provided contains approximately 4500 records, which are currently not formatted for easy human comprehension. My objective is to clean, sort, and visualize the data using the specified libraries, namely pandas, Seaborn, NumPy, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.ticker (ScalarFormatter, FormatStrFormatter), and datetime. By doing so, I aim to provide John Doe with actionable insights and a better understanding of the stock market trends over the specified period.
